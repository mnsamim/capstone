## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project

**Note**
For this project all my code is included in one python file and that is capstone_report_v2.ipynb. You can run jupyter notebook and open that file. There are no other libraries that needed for this project and all of them were already included as part of my Jupyter notebook. So no new requirements. I used python 3 because I needed to run the neural network. Everything else was included so no new libraries. 

My proposal was already completed and here is the link to the final review for that:

The Capstone is a two-staged project. The first is the proposal component, where you can receive valuable feedback about your project idea, design, and proposed solution. This must be completed prior to your implementation and submitting for the capstone project. 

You can find the [capstone proposal rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/410/view), and the [capstone project rubric here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/108/view). Please ensure that you are following directions correctly before submitting these two stages which encapsulate your capstone.

Please email [machine-support@udacity.com](mailto:machine-support@udacity.com) if you have any questions.
